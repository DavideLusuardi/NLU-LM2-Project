author: Davide Lusuardi 223821

## Language Modeling
Implementation of a Recurrent Neural Network Language Model
along with a simple version of LSTM and GRU cells.

The model has been trained on the Penn Treebank (PTB) corpus 
available [here](https://data.deepai.org/ptbdataset.zip).

## Requirements
The following Python libraries are required:

* pytorch
* pandas

## Notebook
The source code file is a Jupyter notebook and can be opened 
with Jupyter or Google Colab. 

Documentation and description of the code is present in the notebook.

The `data` folder contains a subfolder `ptbdataset` that contains 
training, validation and test set of Penn Treebank.
